config NET_ETHADDR_EEPROM
	depends on ARCH_SUNXI
	bool "Get ethaddr from eeprom"
	help
	  Selecting this will try to get the Ethernet address from an onboard
	  EEPROM and set into the environment if and only if the environment
	  does currently not already hold a MAC address. For more information
	  see doc/README.enetaddr.

config NET_ETHADDR_EEPROM_I2C
	depends on NET_ETHADDR_EEPROM
	bool "EEPROM on I2C bus"
	help
	  This switch enables checks for an EEPROM on the I2C bus. Naturally
	  this will only work if there is an actual EEPROM connected on the
	  I2C bus and the bus and device are properly configured via the
	  options below.

config NET_ETHADDR_EEPROM_I2C_BUS
	depends on NET_ETHADDR_EEPROM_I2C
	int "I2C bus"
	default 0
	help
	  Select the bus on which the EEPROM is present, defaults to bus 0.

config NET_ETHADDR_EEPROM_I2C_ADDR
	depends on NET_ETHADDR_EEPROM_I2C
	hex "eeprom address"
	default 0x50
	help
	  Select the address of the eeprom, defaults to address 0x50.

config NET_ETHADDR_EEPROM_I2C_ADDRLEN
	depends on NET_ETHADDR_EEPROM_I2C
	int "eeprom address length"
	default 1
	help
	  Number of bytes to be used for the I2C address length. Typically 1,
	  2 for large memories, 0 for register type devices with only one
	  register.

config NET_ETHADDR_EEPROM_OFFSET
	depends on NET_ETHADDR_EEPROM
	int "EEPROM offset"
	default 8
	help
	  Select the byte offset of the MAC address within the page,
	  defaults to byte 8.

config NET_ETHADDR_EEPROM_CRC8
	depends on NET_ETHADDR_EEPROM
	bool "Check CRC8 of MAC"
	default y
	help
	  Optionally, it is possible to run a CRC-8-CCITT check on the MAC
	  address. To do so, the MAC address is stored with a CRC8 byte append.
	  This option enables the CRC check of the MAC address against the CRC
	  byte.

config NET_RANDOM_ETHADDR
	bool "Random ethaddr if unset"
	select LIB_RAND
	help
	  Selecting this will allow the Ethernet interface to function
	  even when the ethaddr variable for that interface is unset.
	  A new MAC address will be generated on every boot and it will
	  not be added to the environment.
